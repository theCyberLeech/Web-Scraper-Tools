<h1><strong>Creating your first project?</strong></h1>

<p>This was the first time that I had attempted to create a script like this, so I wanted to share with any beginners in Cybersecurity how to start
first project and how to be successful in doing so. </p>

<h3>Find something that interests you</h3>

<p>In this case I was given a tedious task and thought that there must be a quicker way to get the information from the National
Vulnerability Database (NVD) rather than to manually searching for each relevant CVE. So I conducted this browser search:</p>

<p>*"NVD" + "Python" + "library"*</p>

<p> which led me to the <u><a href='https://nvdlib.com/en/latest/index.html'>nvdlib</u></a> Python library</p>
<p> creataed by <a href='https://github.com/vehemont/nvdlib'>vehemont</a>.
<p> there were examples provided in the library, so I reverse engineered how these examples were grabbing the information from NVD.</p>

<h4> Steps that I needed to take to understand the library</h4>

<ul>
  <li>First I needed to grab information from NVD without pulling any specific parameter such as 'published'</li>
  <li>Next I needed to compare the parameters such as 'published' to the code provided to see how the information was parsed</li>
  <li>Time to test it! Grab something from the big block of JSON text using your own code to see if you are able to grab new information</li>
</ul>
